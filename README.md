# qprc_short_course_2021

Notebooks for the Quality and Productivity Research Conference 2021 short course.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this short course, you should be able to:

`Part1.Rmd`

- **Explain** the windows and layout of RStudio
- **Read** in Excel Data and confirm that it was loaded correctly into R
- **Build** a `ggplot2` statement that maps data to aesthetics
- **Style** your ggplot with built in themes to R
- **Facet** your plot by a categorical variable in your dataset

`Part2.Rmd`

-   **List** 5 key `{dplyr}` verbs for data manipulation
-   **Sort** a dataset by columns using `arrange()`
-   **Utilize** the pipe (`%>%`) to chain `{dplyr}` verbs together
-   **Select** columns from a dataset using `select()`
-   **Learn** and apply `mutate()` to change the data type of a variable
-   **Apply** `mutate()` to calculate a new variable based on other variables in a `data.frame`
-   **Apply** `case_when` in a `mutate()` statement to make a continuous variable categorical
-   **Apply** `group_by()/summarize()` as a pattern to get summary statistics, including counts, means, and standard deviations within a category
-   **Standardize** variable names using `clean_names()`

`Part3.Rmd`

- **Incorporate** data sources into your RMarkdown Report
- **Build** and reuse a parametrized RMarkdown report
- **Visualize** time-series data from a data stream
