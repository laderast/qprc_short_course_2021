# BioData Club Code of Conduct

This workshop is governed by the [BioData Club Code of Conduct](https://biodata-club.github.io/code_of_conduct/).

This workshop is meant to be a psychologically safe space where it's ok to ask questions.

I want to normalize your own curiosity and fuel your desire to learn more.

If you are disruptive to class learning or disparaging to other students, I may mute you for the day.

# Rough Breakdown of Today

- 9 - 11:30 AM: Part 1 (ggplot2)/Start Part 2 (dplyr)
- 11:30 - 12:30 PM: Lunch Break
- 12:30 - 2:30 PM: Part 2 (dplyr)
- 2:30 - 3 PM: Break
- 3 - 5 PM: Part 2 / Part 3 (RMarkdown)

We will take short 5 minute breaks every 60 minutes regardless. We will also be doing exercises, so if you need to take a break, you can do so then.

---

# Breakout Rooms

- It's dangerous to learn alone!
- We will assign breakout rooms of 5 students to work together. 
- We will drop in during exercises (usually about 5 minutes long).
- We will pick 1 breakout room to share results.
