# BioData Club Code of Conduct

This workshop is governed by the [BioData Club Code of Conduct](https://biodata-club.github.io/code_of_conduct/).

This workshop is meant to be a psychologically safe space where it's ok to ask questions.

I want to normalize your own curiosity and fuel your desire to learn more.

If you are disruptive to class learning or disparaging to other students, I may mute you for the day.
