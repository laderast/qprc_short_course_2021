## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
stocks <- c("GIS", "K", "NA")
start <- params$date
end <- params$date


options("getSymbols.warning4.0"=FALSE)
options("getSymbols.yahoo.warning"=FALSE)


getSymbols(Symbols = "GE", from = start, to = end,auto.assign = FALSE)

stocks = as.xts(data.frame(GIS = GIS$GIS.Adjusted, , WFC = WFC[, "WFC.Adjusted"]))


## Not run: 
setSymbolLookup(QQQQ='yahoo',SPY='MySQL')

getSymbols(c('QQQQ','SPY'))                
# loads QQQQ from yahoo (set with setSymbolLookup)
# loads SPY from MySQL (set with setSymbolLookup)

getSymbols('F')       
# loads Ford market data from yahoo (the formal default)

setDefaults(getSymbols,verbose=TRUE,src='MySQL')
getSymbols('DIA')                 
# loads symbol from MySQL database (set with setDefaults)

getSymbols('F',src='yahoo',return.class='ts') 
# loads Ford as time series class ts 

## End(Not run)
```

```{r}
general_mills <- tq_get('GIS',
               from = params$date,
               to = params$date,
               get = "stock.prices")

```

```{r}
tickers = c("AAPL", "NFLX", "AMZN", "K", "O")

prices <- tq_get(tickers,
                 from = "2017-01-01",
                 to = "2017-03-01",
                 get = "stock.prices")
```
